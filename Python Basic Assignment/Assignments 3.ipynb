    "> ### 1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "> #### Ans :-  \n",
    "Functions are used to define a block of code that only runs when it is called. To form a function, we pass parameters as data, and it returns data as a result. To have functions in our program makes it easy to understand and completes our task. If we have to do a task that performs the same operation again and again, so we define such operation inside function and we can use that in our programs which makes our program less complex and easy to use. Functions can be used anywhere in the program, we can use function in other module also."

    "> ### 2. When does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when it's called?\n",
    "> #### Ans:- \n",
    "The code inside the function runs when it is called after its definition. We define the function when we use the same operation repeatedly or when the code is to be used in the future also. \n",
    "for eg:\n",
    ">```python\n",
    "> # Funcions definition\n",
    "def add(a, b): # a and b are parameters\n",

    "> #### Ans:- \n",
    "In python **`def`** keyword statement creates a function which means define. The statements in the block of the function must be indented. The def keyword is followed by the function name with round brackets and a colon and the statements it executes.\n",

    "> ### 5. How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?\n",
    "> #### Ans:-\n",
    "In python functions, global scopes are used outside the function or we can define inside the function using the **`global`** keyword whereas local scopes are only used inside the function and which is works as a normal variable.\n",
    "For eg:\n",
    "> ```python\n",
    "a = \"I am global scope\" \n",

    "> #### Ans:-\n",
    "A local variable retains its value until the next time the function is called or function call returns. local variables are those which are defined inside a function and its scope is limited to that function only."

    "> #### Ans:-\n",
    "In general, a function takes arguments, performs some operations, and returns a value or object. The value that a function returns to the caller is generally known as the function's return value. All Python functions have a return value, either explicit or implicit. \n",
    ">\n",
    ">An explicit return statement immediately terminates a function execution and sends the return value back to the caller code whereas if you donâ€™t explicitly use a return value in a return statement, or if you totally ignores the return statement, then Python will implicitly return a default value for you. That default return value will always be None.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Yes, it is possible to have a return value in an expression, If the return statement is without any expression, then the special value None is returned. The expression of return value can be opertion, addition, list, tuple, dictionary, another function or any string values."
